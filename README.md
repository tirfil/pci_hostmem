# pci_hostmem
linux driver allocating memory space for pci bus mastering (dma)

----

This kernel module allocates non cached buffer for dma operations
attached to a pci card.

User can access this buffer in kernel space for read and write operations using
character device (/dev/hostmem)

Ioctl(1) enables to find buffer 's bus address to configure registers in hardware dma.

Others operations with hardware dma could be performed directly in user
space (https://github.com/tirfil/cppPCIBar)

No udev support.

You need to create a device: 
> sudo mknod /dev/hostmem c 60 0.

and change permissions: 
> sudo chmod 666 /dev/hostmem.

Write a C program using file operations (open, read, write, close) to access the buffer (see test_hostmem.c).

Multi buffer mode. Several buffers could be opened and access in with the driver in the same time. 
For example a buffer for RX part and another for TX part.
